            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>
               The timeline above shows which years were the most prominent within the whole musical. It covers 100 years (1755 - 1855) and has 83 events placed on the timeline by year. All events were selected from the songs (and one spoken scene)  and every song was assigned to have at least one event occurring in it. If the song had no distinct events mentioned in the lyrics (due to not being historically accurate or vague), an estimated date was assigned to the song to keep the musical in a chronological order. The events chosen had to be mentioned in the lyrics in order to be further investigated and placed onto the timeline. Most dates are historically accurate, but some dates are only accurate within the musical. A detailed description of the events and dates that occur in each song is below:

            <li>1757-01-11: <i>Alexander Hamilton's Birth</i> - Alexander Hamilton was born in Charlestown, St. Kitts and Nevis. There is a debate
               that he was born two years earlier in 1755, but 1757 matches closer to ages listed
               in the musical.
            </li>
            <li>1767-01-16: <i>Hamilton's Father Left</i> - James Hamilton, Alexander Hamilton's father and a Scottish Laird, left Hamilton and
               his family, most likely due to the fact Alexander was his illegitimate son. This date
               is estimated from the song lyrics describing Alexander Hamilton as ten when his father
               left.
            </li>
            <li>1768-02-19: <i>Hamilton's Mother Dies</i> - Rachel Faucette Buck, Hamilton's mother, died on February 19, 1768. After her death,

            <li>1771-01-16: <i>Hamilton In Charge of a Trading Charter</i> - The lyrics in "Alexander Hamilton" describe Hamilton being in charge of a trading
               charter when he was fourteen. This is an estimated date to show when he would be in

               of the island's elite. The letter was how he "wrote his way out" and got to travel

               Hamilton to Aaron Burr, and three other prominent characters in the musical and history,
               John Laurens, Marquis de Lafayette, and Hercules Mulligan. This date is not historically
               accurate though as these men all met Hamilton at different times prior to 1776.

            <h2>Analysis:</h2>
            <p>As an overview, the timeline helps place the musical in a specific time frame and shows which years the plot focuses on the most. Years such as 1780 (the year Hamilton is married to Eliza), 1776 (the year in the musical when all the characters are introduced), 1789 (the year Washington becomes president), 1797 (the year Hamilton publishes the Reynolds Pamphlet), 1800(the year of the election of 1800), 1801 (the year Hamiltonâ€™s son Philip dies), and 1804 (the year Hamilton dies) are major years on the timeline and show how the musical tends to focus on Hamilton as an individual more so than the American Revolution or the beginning of Americaâ€™s politics and government. Also, when looking into the detailed description of all the events and dates, it can be seen that the musical is not 100% factual. For example, the musical sets up the year 1776 as the year Hamilton meets Burr, Laurens, Lafayette, and Mulligan when in actuality they met prior to that date and it is never recorded that the five men were ever all together. There are also some historical inaccuracies as the musical gives exact ages of Hamilton during certain events of Hamiltonâ€™s life, such as his motherâ€™s death, which do not match up to actual dates and how old Hamilton would have really been during that event. The musical also has some songs in act two that go out of chronological order. These songs all deal with Hamiltonâ€™s personal life involving his sonâ€™s death and the Hamilton family coping with that loss and moving to Harlem, New York in 1801 and 1802. It can be assumed that the break away from chronology was for plot reasons so the musical would have a consistent mix of politics and Hamiltonâ€™s personal life since those songs precede the end of the musical which focuses on the Election of 1800 and Hamilton and Burrâ€™s duel. Overall, the musicalâ€™s timeline matches up to historical dates and the songs fall in chronological order. When there are differences, they can be attributed to the fact the musical has to follow a suitable format for an audience where main characters need to be introduced promptly and themes need to be placed appropriately. </p>
