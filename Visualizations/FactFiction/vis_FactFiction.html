            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>The bar graph above shows the division of factual, fictional, and
               ambiguous lyrics as percentages. In the musical, we tagged a total of
               208 lyrics; 160 were factual, 36 were fictional, and 12 were ambiguous.
               The lyrics were chosen by team members as lines that suggested further
               research or raised questions of authenticity.

                           United States Constitution, entitled The
                           Federalist Papers. The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays, the
                           work divided evenly among the three men. In the end, they wrote eighty-five
                           essays, in the span of six months. John Jay
                           got sick after writing five. James
                           Madison wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one!
