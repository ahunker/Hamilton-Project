                    <l>I was louder than the crack in the bell</l>

                    <l>I wrote about The Constitution and defended it well</l>
                    <l>And in the face of ignorance and resistance</l>
                    <l>I wrote financial systems into existence</l>
                    <l>And when my prayers to God were met with indifference</l>
                    <l>I picked up a pen, I wrote my own deliverance</l>
