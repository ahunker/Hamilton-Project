                    <l>I saved every letter you wrote me</l>
                    <l>From the moment I read them</l>
                    <l>I knew you were mine</l>
                    <l>You said you were mine</l>
                    <l>I thought you were mine</l>


                    <l>Do you know what <persName ref="#angelica">Angelica</persName> said</l>
                    <l>When we saw your first letter arrive?</l>
                    <l>She said</l>


                    <l>“Be careful with that one, love</l>
                    <l>He will do what it takes to survive.”</l>


                    <l>You and your words flooded my senses</l>
                    <l>Your sentences left me defenseless</l>
                    <l>You built me palaces out of paragraphs</l>
                    <l>You built cathedrals</l>
                    <l>I’m re-reading the letters you wrote me</l>
                    <l>I’m searching and scanning for answers</l>
                    <l>In every line</l>
                    <l>For some kind of sign</l>
                    <l>And when you were mine</l>
                    <l>The world seemed to</l>


                    <l>Burn</l>
                    <l>Burn</l>


                    <l>You published the letters she wrote you</l>
                    <l>You told the whole world how you brought</l>
                    <l>This girl into our bed</l>
                    <l>In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives</l>
                    <l>Do you know what <persName ref="#angelica">Angelica</persName> said</l>
                    <l>When she read what you’d done?</l>
                    <l>She said</l>
                    <l>“You have married an Icarus</l>
                    <l>He has flown too close to the sun.”</l>


                    <l>You and your words, obsessed with your legacy...</l>
                    <l>Your sentences border on senseless</l>
                    <l>And you are paranoid in every paragraph</l>
                    <l>How they perceive you</l>


                    <l>You, you, you…</l>


                    <l>I’m erasing myself from the narrative</l>
                    <l>Let future historians wonder how <persName ref="#eliza">Eliza</persName></l>
                    <l>Reacted when you broke her heart</l>
                    <l>You have torn it all apart</l>
                    <l>I am watching it</l>
                    <l>Burn</l>
                    <l>Watching it burn</l>
                    <l>The world has no right to my heart</l>
                    <l>The world has no place in our bed</l>
                    <l>They don’t get to know what I said</l>
                    <l>I’m burning the memories</l>
                    <l>Burning the letters that might have redeemed you</l>
                    <l>You forfeit all rights to my heart</l>
                    <l>You forfeit the place in our bed</l>
                    <l>You sleep in your office instead</l>
                    <l>With only the memories</l>
                    <l>Of when you were mine</l>
                    <l>I hope that you burn</l>
