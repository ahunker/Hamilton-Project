<sp who="#washington"><speaker>WASHINGTON</speaker>
<l>The issue on the table: France is on the verge of war with England</l>
<l>And do we provide aid and our troops to our French allies or do we stay out of it?</l>
<l>Remember, my decision on this matter is not subject to congressional approval</l>
<l>The only person you have to convince is me</l>
<l>Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir</l></sp>


<sp who="#jefferson"><speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>When we were on death’s door, when we were needy</l>
<l>We made a promise, we signed a treaty</l>
<l>We needed money and guns and half a chance</l>
<l>Who provided those funds?</l></sp>


<sp who="#madison"><speaker>MADISON</speaker>
<l>France</l></sp>


<sp who="#jefferson"><speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>In return, they didn’t ask for land</l>
<l>Only a promise that we’d lend a hand</l>
<l>And stand with them if they fought against oppressors</l>
<l>And revolution is messy but now is the time to stand</l>
<l>Stand with our brothers as they fight against tyranny</l>
<l>I know that Alexander Hamilton is here and he</l>
<l>Would rather not have this debate</l>
<l>I’ll remind you that he is not Secretary of State</l>
<l>He knows nothing of loyalty</l>
<l>Smells like new money, dresses like fake royalty</l>
<l>Desperate to rise above his station</l>
<l>Everything he does betrays the ideals of our nation</l></sp>


<sp who="#ensemble"><speaker>ENSEMBLE</speaker>
<l>Ooh!!</l></sp>


<sp who="#jefferson"><speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>Hey, and if ya don’t know, now ya know, Mr. President</l></sp>


<sp who="#washington"><speaker>WASHINGTON</speaker>
<l>Thank you, Secretary Jefferson. Secretary Hamilton, your response</l></sp>


<sp who="#hamilton"><speaker>HAMILTON</speaker>
<l>You must be out of your Goddamn mind if you think</l>
<l>The President is gonna bring the nation to the brink</l>
<l>Of meddling in the middle of a military mess</l>
<l>A game of chess, where France is Queen and Kingless</l>
<l>We signed a treaty with a King whose head is now in a basket</l>
<l>Would you like to take it out and ask it?</l>
<l>“Should we honor our treaty, King Louis’ head?”</l>
<l>“Uh… do whatever you want, I’m super dead.”</l></sp>


<sp who="#washington"><speaker>WASHINGTON</speaker>
<l>Enough. Hamilton is right</l></sp>


<sp who="#jefferson"><speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>Mr. President—</l></sp>


<sp who="#washington"><speaker>WASHINGTON</speaker>
<l>We’re too fragile to start another fight</l></sp>


<sp who="#jefferson"><speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>But sir, do we not fight for freedom?</l></sp>


<sp who="#washington"><speaker>WASHINGTON</speaker>
<l>Sure, when the French figure out who’s gonna lead ‘em</l></sp>


<sp who="#jefferson"><speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>The people are leading—</l></sp>


<sp who="#washington"><speaker>WASHINGTON</speaker>
<l>The people are rioting</l>
<l>There’s a difference. Frankly, it’s a little disquieting you would let your ideals blind you to reality</l>
<l>Hamilton</l></sp>


<sp who="#hamilton"><speaker>HAMILTON</speaker>
<l>Sir</l></sp>


<sp who="#washington"><speaker>WASHINGTON</speaker>
<l>Draft a statement of neutrality</l></sp>


<sp who="#jefferson"><speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>Did you forget Lafayette?</l></sp>


<sp who="#hamilton"><speaker>HAMILTON</speaker>
<l>What?</l></sp>


<sp who="#jefferson"><speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>Have you an ounce of regret?</l>
<l>You accumulate debt, you accumulate power</l>
<l>Yet in their hour of need, you forget</l></sp>


<sp who="#hamilton"><speaker>HAMILTON</speaker>
<l>Lafayette’s a smart man, he’ll be fine</l>
<l>And before he was your friend, he was mine</l>
<l>If we try to fight in every revolution in the world, we never stop</l>
<l>Where do we draw the line?</l></sp>


<sp who="#jefferson"><speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>So quick-witted</l></sp>


<sp who="#hamilton"><speaker>HAMILTON</speaker>
<l>Alas, I admit it</l></sp>


<sp who="#jefferson"><speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>I bet you were quite a lawyer</l></sp>


<sp who="#hamilton"><speaker>HAMILTON</speaker>
<l>My defendants got acquitted</l></sp>


<sp who="#jefferson"><speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>Yeah. Well, someone oughta remind you</l></sp>


<sp who="#hamilton"><speaker>HAMILTON</speaker>
<l>What?</l></sp>


<sp who="#jefferson"><speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>You’re nothing without Washington behind you</l></sp>


<sp who="#washington"><speaker>WASHINGTON</speaker>
<l>Hamilton!</l></sp>


<sp who="#jefferson"><speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>Daddy’s calling!</l></sp>
