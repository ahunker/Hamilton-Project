<l>The election of 1800</l></sp>

<sp who="#jefferson"><speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>Can we get back to politics?</l></sp>

<sp who="#madison"><speaker>MADISON</speaker>
<l>Please?</l></sp>

<sp who="#jefferson"><speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>Yo. Ev’ry action has an equal, opposite reaction</l>
<l>John Adams shat the bed. I love the guy, but he’s in traction</l>
<l>Poor Alexander Hamilton? He is missing in action</l>
<l>So now I’m facing—</l></sp>

<sp who="#jefferson #madison"><speaker>JEFFERSON AND MADISON</speaker>
<l>Aaron Burr!</l></sp>

<sp who="#jefferson"><speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>With his own faction</l></sp>

<sp who="#madison"><speaker>MADISON</speaker>
<l>He’s very attractive in the North. New Yorkers like his chances</l></sp>

<sp who="#jefferson"><speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>He’s not very forthcoming on any particular stances</l></sp>

<sp who="#madison"><speaker>MADISON</speaker>
<l>Ask him a question: it glances off, he obfuscates, he dances</l></sp>

<sp who="#jefferson"><speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>And they say I’m a Francophile: at least they know I know where France is!</l></sp>

<sp who="#madison"><speaker>MADISON</speaker>
<l>Thomas that’s the problem, see, they see Burr as a less extreme you</l></sp>

<sp who="#jefferson"><speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>Ha!</l></sp>

<sp who="#madison"><speaker>MADISON</speaker>
<l>You need to change course, a key endorsement might redeem you</l></sp>

<sp who="#jefferson"><speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>Who did you have in mind?</l></sp>

<sp who="#madison"><speaker>MADISON</speaker>
<l>Don’t laugh</l></sp>

<sp who="#jefferson"><speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>Who is it?</l></sp>

<sp who="#madison"><speaker>MADISON</speaker>
<l>You used to work on the same staff</l></sp>

<sp who="#jefferson"><speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>Whaaaat</l></sp>

<sp who="#madison"><speaker>MADISON</speaker>
<l>It might be nice, it might be nice</l>
<l>To get Hamilton on your side</l></sp>

<sp who="#jefferson #madison"><speaker>JEFFERSON AND MADISON</speaker>
