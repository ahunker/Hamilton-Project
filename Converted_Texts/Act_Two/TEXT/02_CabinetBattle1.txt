<title>CABINET BATTLE #1</title>

 <div type="song">
<sp who="washington">
<speaker>WASHINGTON</speaker>
<l>Ladies and gentlemen, you coulda been anywhere in the world tonight, but you're here with us in New York City. Are you ready for a cabinet meeting???</l>
<l>The issue on the table: Secretary Hamilton's plan to assume state debt and establish a national bank. Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#jefferson">
<speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>'Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.'</l>
<l>We fought for these ideals; we shouldn't settle for less</l>
<l>These are wise words, enterprising men quote 'em</l>
<l>Don't act surprised, you guys, cuz I wrote 'em</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#jefferson #madison">
<speaker>JEFFERSON/MADISON</speaker>
<l>Oww</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#jefferson">
<speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>But Hamilton forgets</l>
<l>His plan would have the government assume state's debts</l>
<l>Now, place your bets as to who that benefits:</l>
<l>The very seat of government where Hamilton sits</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#hamilton">
<speaker>HAMILTON</speaker>
<l>Not true!</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#jefferson">
<speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>Ooh, if the shoe fits, wear it</l>
<l>If New York's in debt</l>
<l>Why should Virginia bear it? Uh! Our debts are paid, I'm afraid</l>
<l>Don't tax the South cuz we got it made in the shade</l>
<l>In Virginia, we plant seeds in the ground</l>
<l>We create. You just wanna move our money around</l>
<l>This financial plan is an outrageous demand</l>
<l>And it's too many damn pages for any man to understand</l>
<l>Stand with me in the land of the free</l>
<l>And pray to God we never see Hamilton’s candidacy</l>
<l>Look, when Britain taxed our tea, we got frisky</l>
<l>Imagine what gon' happen when you try to tax our whisky</l>

<sp who="#washington">
<l>WASHINGTON</l>
<l>Thank you, Secretary Jefferson</l>
<l>Secretary Hamilton, your response</l>

<sp who="#hamilton">
<speaker>HAMILTON</speaker>
<l>Thomas. That was a real nice declaration</l>
<l>Welcome to the present, were running a real nation</l>
<l>Would you like to join us, or stay mellow</l>
<l>Doin' whatever the hell it is you do in Monticello?</l>
<l>If we assume the debts, the union gets</l>
<l>A new line of credit, a financial diuretic</l>
<l>How do you not get it? If were aggressive and competitive</l>
<l>The union gets a boost. You'd rather give it a sedative?</l>
<l>A civics lesson from a slaver. Hey neighbor</l>
<l>Your debts are paid cuz you don't pay for labor</l>
<l>"We plant seeds in the South. We create."</l>
<l>Yeah, keep ranting</l>
<l>We know who's really doing the planting</l>
<l>And another thing, Mr. Age of Enlightenment</l>
<l>Don't lecture me about the war, you didn't fight in it</l>
<l>You think I'm frightened of you, man?</l>
<l>We almost died in the trench</l>
<l>While you were off getting high with the French</l>
<l>Thomas Jefferson, always hesitant with the President</l>
<l>Reticent there isn't a plan he doesn't jettison</l>
<l>Madison, you're mad as a hatter, son, take your medicine</l>
<l>Damn, you're in worse shape than the national debt is in</l>
<l>Sittin' there useless as two shits</l>
<l>Hey, turn around, bend over, I'll show you</l>
<l>Where my shoe fits</l>

<sp who="#washington">
<speaker>WASHINGTON</speaker>
<l>Excuse me? Madison, Jefferson, take a walk! Hamilton, take a walk! Well reconvene after a brief recess. Hamilton!</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#hamilton">
<speaker>HAMILTON</speaker>
<l>Sir!</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#washington">
<speaker>WASHINGTON</speaker>
<l>A word</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#madison">
<speaker>MADISON</speaker>
<l>You don't have the votes</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#jefferson #madison">
<speaker>JEFFERSON/MADISON</speaker>
<l>You don't have the votes</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#jefferson">
<speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>Aha-ha-ha ha!</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#jefferson #madison">
<speaker>JEFFERSON/MADISON</speaker>
<l>You're gonna need congressional approval and you don't have the votes</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#jefferson">
<speaker>JEFFERSON</speaker>
<l>Such a blunder sometimes it makes me wonder why I even bring the thunder</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#madison">
<speaker>MADISON</speaker>
<l>Why he even brings the thunder</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#washington">
<speaker>WASHINGTON</speaker>
<l>You wanna pull yourself together?</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#hamilton">
<speaker>HAMILTON</speaker>
<l>I'm sorry, these Virginians are birds of a feather</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#washington">
<speaker>WASHINGTON</speaker>
<l>Young man, I'm from Virginia, so watch your mouth</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#hamilton">
<speaker>HAMILTON</speaker>
<l>So we let Congress get held hostage by the South?</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#washington">
<speaker>WASHINGTON</speaker>
<l>You need the votes</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#hamilton">
<speaker>HAMILTON</speaker>
<l>No, we need bold strokes. We need this plan</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#washington">
<speaker>WASHINGTON</speaker>
<l>No, you need to convince more folks</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#hamilton">
<speaker>HAMILTON</speaker>
<l>James Madison won't talk to me, that’s a nonstarter</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#washington">
<speaker>WASHINGTON</speaker>
<l>Winning was easy, young man. Governing’s harder</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#hamilton">
<speaker>HAMILTON</speaker>
<l>They're being intransigent</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#washington">
<speaker>WASHINGTON</speaker>
<l>You have to find a compromise</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#hamilton">
<speaker>HAMILTON</speaker>
<l>But they don't have a plan, they just hate mine!</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#washington">
<speaker>WASHINGTON</speaker>
<l>Convince them otherwise</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#hamilton">
<speaker>HAMILTON</speaker>
<l>What happens if I don't get congressional approval?</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#washington">
<speaker>WASHINGTON</speaker>
<l>I imagine they'll call for your removal</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#hamilton">
<speaker>HAMILTON</speaker>
<l>Sir</l>
</sp>


<sp who="#washington">
