                    <l>In the eye of a hurricane</l>
                    <l>There is quiet</l>
                    <l>For just a moment</l>
                    <l>A yellow sky</l>


                    <l>When I was seventeen a hurricane</l>
                    <l>Destroyed my town</l>
                    <l>I didn’t drown</l>
                    <l>I couldn’t seem to die</l>


                    <l>I wrote my way out</l>
                    <l>Wrote everything down far as I could see</l>
                    <l>I wrote my way out</l>
                    <l>I looked up and the town had its eyes on me</l>


                    <l>They passed a plate around</l>
                    <l>Total strangers</l>
                    <l>Moved to kindness by my story</l>
                    <l>Raised enough for me to book passage on a</l>
                    <l>Ship that was <placeName>New York</placeName> bound…</l>


                    <l>I wrote my way out of hell</l>
                    <l>I wrote my way to revolution</l>
                    <l>I was louder than the crack in the bell</l>
                    <l>I wrote <persName ref="#eliza">Eliza</persName> love letters until she fell</l>
                    <l>I wrote about The Constitution and defended it well</l>
                    <l>And in the face of ignorance and resistance</l>
                    <l>I wrote financial systems into existence</l>
                    <l>And when my prayers to God were met with indifference</l>
                    <l>I picked up a pen, I wrote my own deliverance</l>


                    <l>In the eye of a hurricane</l>
                    <l>There is quiet</l>
                    <l>For just a moment</l>
                    <l>A yellow sky</l>


                    <l>I was twelve when my mother died</l>
                    <l>She was holding me</l>
                    <l>We were sick and she was holding me</l>
                    <l>I couldn’t seem to die</l>
