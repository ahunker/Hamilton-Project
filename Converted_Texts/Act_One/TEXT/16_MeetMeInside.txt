Meet Me Inside

[HAMILTON]
Lee, do you yield?

[BURR]
You shot him in the side!
Yes, he yields!

[LAURENS]
I’m satisfied

[BURR]
Yo, we gotta clear the field!

[HAMILTON]
Go! We won

[COMPANY]
Here comes the General!

[BURR]
This should be fun

[WASHINGTON]
What is the meaning of this? Mr. Burr, get a medic for the General

[BURR]
Yes, sir

[WASHINGTON]
Lee, you will never agree with me
But believe me, these young men don’t speak for me
Thank you for your service

[BURR]
Let’s ride!

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Meet me inside

[COMPANY]
Meet him inside! Meet him inside!
Meet him inside, meet him, meet him inside!

[WASHINGTON]
Son—

[HAMILTON]
Don’t call me son

[WASHINGTON]
This war is hard enough
Without infighting—

[HAMILTON]
Lee called you out. We called his bluff

[WASHINGTON]
You solve nothing, you aggravate our allies to the south

[HAMILTON]
You're absolutely right, John should have shot him in the mouth
That would’ve shut him up

[WASHINGTON]
Son—

[HAMILTON]
I’m notcha son—

[WASHINGTON]
Watch your tone
I am not a maiden in need of defending, I am grown

[HAMILTON (OVERLAPPING)]
Charles Lee, Thomas Conway
These men take your name and they rake it
Through the mud

[WASHINGTON]
My name’s been through a lot, I can take it

[HAMILTON]
Well, I don’t have your name. I don’t have your titles
I don’t have your land
But, if you—

[WASHINGTON]
No—

[HAMILTON]
If you gave me command of a battalion, a group of men to lead, I could fly above my station after the war

[WASHINGTON]
Or you could die and we need you alive

[HAMILTON]
I’m more than willing to die—

[WASHINGTON]
Your wife needs you alive, son, I need you alive—

[HAMILTON]
Call me son one more time—

[WASHINGTON]
Go home, Alexander
That’s an order from your commander

[HAMILTON]
Sir—

[WASHINGTON]
Go home
