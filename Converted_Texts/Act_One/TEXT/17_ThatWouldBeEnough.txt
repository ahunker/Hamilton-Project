That Would Be Enough

[ELIZA]
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around…

[HAMILTON]
How long have you known?

[ELIZA]
A month or so

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, you should have told me

[ELIZA]
I wrote to the General a month ago

[HAMILTON]
No

[ELIZA]
I begged him to send you home

[HAMILTON]
You should have told me

[ELIZA]
I’m not sorry

[ELIZA]
I knew you’d fight
Until the war was won

But you deserve a chance to meet your son
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now.	 
[HAMILTON]
The war’s not
Done.
 
[HAMILTON]
Will you relish being a poor man’s wife
Unable to provide for your life?

[ELIZA]
I relish being your wife
Look around, look around…

Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you’re alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough

And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough

I don’t pretend to know
The challenges you’re facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind

But I’m not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough

We don’t need a legacy
We don’t need money
If I could grant you peace of mind
If you could let me inside your heart…

Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay
And I could be enough
And we could be enough
That would be enough
