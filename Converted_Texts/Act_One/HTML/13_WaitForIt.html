            <span class="persName">Theodosia</span> writes me a letter
            every day<br />
            I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away<br />
            He's on the British side in <span class="placeName">Georgia</span><br />
            He's trying to keep the colonies in line<br />
            But he can keep all of <span class="placeName">Georgia</span><br />
            <span class="persName">Theodosia</span>, she's mine<br />
            Love doesn't discriminate<br />
            Between the sinners<br />
            And the saints<br />
            It takes and it takes and it takes<br />
            And we keep loving anyway<br />
            We laugh and we cry<br />
            And we break<br />
            And we make our mistakes<br />
            And if there's a reason I'm by her side<br />
            When so many have tried<br />
            Then I'm willing to wait for it<br />
            I'm willing to wait for it<br />
