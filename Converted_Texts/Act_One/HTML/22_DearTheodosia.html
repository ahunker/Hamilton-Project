            <h2>Dear Theodosia</h2>
            
            
            
            
            <br /><strong>BURR</strong><br />
            Dear <span class="persName">Theodosia</span>, what to say to
            you?<br />
            You have my eyes. You have your mother’s name<br />
            When you came into the world, you cried and it broke my heart<br />
            I’m dedicating every day to you<br />
            Domestic life was never quite my style<br />
            When you smile, you knock me out, I fall apart<br />
            And I thought I was so smart<br />
            You will come of age with our young nation<br />
            We’ll bleed and fight for you, we’ll make it right for you<br />
            If we lay a strong enough foundation<br />
            We’ll pass it on to you, we’ll give the world to you<br />
            And you’ll blow us all away…<br />
            Someday, someday<br />
            Yeah, you’ll blow us all away<br />
            Someday, someday<br />
            
            
            
            <br /><strong>HAMILTON</strong><br />
            Oh <span class="persName">Philip</span>, when you smile I am undone<br />
            My son<br />
            Look at my son. Pride is not the word I’m looking for<br />
            There is so much more inside me now<br />
            Oh <span class="persName">Philip</span>, you outshine the morning
            sun<br />
            My son<br />
            When you smile, I fall apart<br />
            And I thought I was so smart<br />
            My father wasn’t around<br />
            
            
            
            <br /><strong>BURR</strong><br />
            My father wasn’t around<br />
            
            
            
            <br /><strong>HAMILTON</strong><br />
            I swear that<br />
            
            
            
            <br /><strong>HAMILTON/BURR</strong><br />
            I’ll be around for you.<br />
            
            
            
            <br /><strong>HAMILTON</strong><br />
            I’ll do whatever it takes<br />
            
            
            
            <br /><strong>BURR</strong><br />
            I’ll make a million mistakes<br />
            
            
            
            <br /><strong>BURR/HAMILTON</strong><br />
            I’ll make the world safe and sound for you…<br />
            …will come of age with our young nation<br />
            We’ll bleed and fight for you, we’ll make it right for you<br />
            If we lay a strong enough foundation<br />
            We’ll pass it on to you, we’ll give the world to you<br />
            And you’ll blow us all away...<br />
            Someday, someday<br />
            Yeah, you’ll blow us all away<br />
            Someday, someday<br />
