Up-Conversion Process on Alexander Hamilton:

Step 1. Replacing special characters.
Find: &
Replace: &amp;
 Searched for < and > but didn't find any.

Step 2. Like poetry, the format of the individual lines need to be kept intact, so line breaks are require after each line of lrics.
Find: ^.+$
Replace: \0<lb/>
 Some self closing tags were after white space on line that didn't contain text.
Find: ^\s+<lb/>$
Replace: (I left this blank)

Step 3. Wrapping stage directions. They appear inside parantheses, so I searched for everything isnide parantheses and removed the pseudomarkup.
Find: \((.+?)\)[<lb/>]*
Replace: <stageDirection>\1</stageDirection>

Step 4. Remove extra whitespace in the document.
Find: \n{3,}
Replace: \n\n
 I noticed some of the speaker names were all formatted the same, so I fixed this as well. In some palces, there was only on new line and a name where most had two new lines and a name.
Find: (<lb/>\n)(\[)
Replace: \1\n\2

Step 5. Wrap speaker names and wrap what each speaker is saying into speeches.
Find: (\n\n)\[(.+?)\]<lb/>
Replace: </sp>\1<sp><speaker>\2</speaker>
 I had to remove the extra </sp> at the beginning and add it to the end of the document. I searched for any extra brackets and found that two speakers were formatted differently and ended at the end of a line so I had to fix these.
Find: \[.+?\]
Replace: \n\n\0
 I had to manually add the <lb/> element to the end of the lines above these two.
 I then repeated the steps above.

Step 6. Manually wrap the title and add root element.
