            How long have you known?<br />
            
            
            
            <br /><strong>ELIZA</strong><br />
            A month or so<br />
            
            
            
            <br /><strong>HAMILTON</strong><br />
            <span class="persName">Eliza</span>, you should have told me<br />
            
            
            
            <br /><strong>ELIZA</strong><br />
            I wrote to the <span class="persName">General</span> a month ago<br />
            
            
            
            <br /><strong>HAMILTON</strong><br />
            No<br />
            
            
            
            <br /><strong>ELIZA</strong><br />
            I begged him to send you home<br />
            
            
            
            <br /><strong>HAMILTON</strong><br />
            You should have told me<br />
            
            
            
            <br /><strong>ELIZA</strong><br />
            I’m not sorry<br />
            I knew you’d fight<br />
            Until the war was won<br />
            
            
            
            <br /><strong>HAMILTON</strong><br />
            The war’s not<br />
            Done.<br />
            
            
            
            <br /><strong>ELIZA</strong><br />
            But you deserve a chance to meet your son<br />
            Look around, look around at how lucky we are<br />
            To be alive right now.<br />
            
            
            
            <br /><strong>HAMILTON</strong><br />
            Will you relish being a poor man’s wife<br />
            Unable to provide for your life?<br />
            
            
            
            <br /><strong>ELIZA</strong><br />
            I relish being your wife<br />
            Look around, look around…<br />
            Look at where you are<br />
            Look at where you started<br />
            The fact that you’re alive is a miracle<br />
            Just stay alive, that would be enough<br />
            And if this child<br />
            Shares a fraction of your smile<br />
            Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!<br />
            That would be enough<br />
            I don’t pretend to know<br />
            The challenges you’re facing<br />
            The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind<br />
            But I’m not afraid<br />
            I know who I married<br />
            So long as you come home at the end of the day<br />
            That would be enough<br />
            We don’t need a legacy<br />
            We don’t need money<br />
            If I could grant you peace of mind<br />
            If you could let me inside your heart…<br />
            Oh, let me be a part of the narrative<br />
            In the story they will write someday<br />
            Let this moment be the first chapter:<br />
            Where you decide to stay<br />
            And I could be enough<br />
            And we could be enough<br />
            That would be enough<br />
