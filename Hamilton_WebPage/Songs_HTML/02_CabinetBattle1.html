               for a cabinet meeting???<br />
               The issue on the table: <span class="persName">Secretary
                  Hamilton's</span> plan to assume state debt and establish a national
               bank. <span class="persName">Secretary Jefferson</span>, you have

               But <span class="persName">Hamilton</span> forgets<br />
               His plan would have the government assume state's debts<br />
               Now, place your bets as to who that benefits:<br />

               I'm afraid<br />
               Don't tax the <span class="placeName">South</span> cuz we got it made in the

               We create. You just wanna move our money around<br />
               This financial plan is an outrageous demand<br />
               And it's too many damn pages for any man to understand<br />
               Stand with me in the land of the free<br />
               And pray to God we never see <span class="persName">Hamilton’s</span>
               candidacy<br />
               Look, when <span class="placeName">Britain</span> taxed our tea, we got frisky<br />

               If we assume the debts, the union gets<br />
               A new line of credit, a financial diuretic<br />
               How do you not get it? If were aggressive and competitive<br />
               The union gets a boost. You'd rather give it a sedative?<br />
               A civics lesson from a slaver. Hey neighbor<br />
               Your debts are paid cuz you don't pay for labor<br />
               "We plant seeds in the South. We create."<br />
               Yeah, keep ranting<br />
               We know who's really doing the planting<br />
               And another thing, Mr. Age of Enlightenment<br />
               Don't lecture me about the war, you didn't fight in it<br />
               You think I'm frightened of you, man?<br />
