               There are moments that the words don't reach<br />
               There is suffering too terrible to name<br />
               You hold your child as tight as you can<br />
               And push away the unimaginable<br />
               The moments when you're in so deep<br />
               It feels easier to just swim down<br />

               I spend hours in the garden<br />
               I walk alone to the store<br />
               And it's quiet uptown<br />
               I never liked the quiet before<br />
               I take the children to church on Sunday<br />
               A sign of the cross at the door<br />
               And I pray<br />
               That never used to happen before<br />
