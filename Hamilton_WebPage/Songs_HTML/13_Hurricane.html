               <br /><strong>HAMILTON</strong><br />
               In the eye of a hurricane<br />
               There is quiet<br />
               For just a moment<br />
               A yellow sky<br />
               
               
               When I was seventeen a hurricane<br />
               Destroyed my town<br />
               I didn’t drown<br />
               I couldn’t seem to die<br />
               
               
               I wrote my way out<br />
               Wrote everything down far as I could see<br />
               I wrote my way out<br />
               I looked up and the town had its eyes on me<br />
               
               
               They passed a plate around<br />
               Total strangers<br />
               Moved to kindness by my story<br />
               Raised enough for me to book passage on a<br />
               Ship that was <span class="placeName">New York</span> bound…<br />
               
               
               I wrote my way out of hell<br />
               I wrote my way to revolution<br />
               I was louder than the crack in the bell<br />
               I wrote <span class="persName">Eliza</span> love letters until she fell<br />
               I wrote about The Constitution and defended it well<br />
               And in the face of ignorance and resistance<br />
               I wrote financial systems into existence<br />
               And when my prayers to God were met with indifference<br />
               I picked up a pen, I wrote my own deliverance<br />
               
               
               In the eye of a hurricane<br />
               There is quiet<br />
               For just a moment<br />
               A yellow sky<br />
               
               
               I was twelve when my mother died<br />
               She was holding me<br />
               We were sick and she was holding me<br />
               I couldn’t seem to die<br />
