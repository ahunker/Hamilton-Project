               <br /><strong>ELIZA</strong><br />
               I saved every letter you wrote me<br />
               From the moment I read them<br />
               I knew you were mine<br />
               You said you were mine<br />
               I thought you were mine<br />
               
               
               Do you know what <span class="persName">Angelica</span> said<br />
               When we saw your first letter arrive?<br />
               She said<br />
               
               
               “Be careful with that one, love<br />
               He will do what it takes to survive.”<br />
               
               
               You and your words flooded my senses<br />
               Your sentences left me defenseless<br />
               You built me palaces out of paragraphs<br />
               You built cathedrals<br />
               I’m re-reading the letters you wrote me<br />
               I’m searching and scanning for answers<br />
               In every line<br />
               For some kind of sign<br />
               And when you were mine<br />
               The world seemed to<br />
               
               
               Burn<br />
               Burn<br />
               
               
               You published the letters she wrote you<br />
               You told the whole world how you brought<br />
               This girl into our bed<br />
               In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives<br />
               Do you know what <span class="persName">Angelica</span> said<br />
               When she read what you’d done?<br />
               She said<br />
               “You have married an Icarus<br />
               He has flown too close to the sun.”<br />
               
               
               You and your words, obsessed with your <span class="phr">legacy</span>...<br />
               Your sentences border on senseless<br />
               And you are paranoid in every paragraph<br />
               How they perceive you<br />
               
               
               You, you, you…<br />
               
               
               I’m erasing myself from the narrative<br />
               Let future historians wonder how <span class="persName">Eliza</span><br />
               Reacted when you broke her heart<br />
               You have torn it all apart<br />
               I am watching it<br />
               Burn<br />
               Watching it burn<br />
               The world has no right to my heart<br />
               The world has no place in our bed<br />
               They don’t get to know what I said<br />
               I’m burning the memories<br />
               Burning the letters that might have redeemed you<br />
               You forfeit all rights to my heart<br />
               You forfeit the place in our bed<br />
               You sleep in your office instead<br />
               With only the memories<br />
               Of when you were mine<br />
               I hope that you burn<br />
