                <p>Welcome to The Hamilton Project! <i><a href="http://www.hamiltonbroadway.com"
                            >Hamilton: An American Musical</a></i>, is a show that follows the life
                    of the United States first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton. It
                    became a worldwide sensation and has since won numerous awards, including 11
                    Tony Awards, a Grammy, and a Pulitzer prize. Our aim with this project is to
                    analyze Lin-Manuel Miranda's intricate lyrics in order to gain a better
                    understandning of the history, the characters, and the story itself. </p>
