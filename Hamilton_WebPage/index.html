                <p>Welcome to The Hamilton Project! <i><a href="http://www.hamiltonbroadway.com"
                            >Hamilton: An American Musical</a></i>, is a show that follows the life
                    of the United States first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton. It
                    became a worldwide sensation and has since won numerous awards. Our aim with this project is to
                    analyze Lin-Manuel Miranda's intricate lyrics in order to gain a better
                    understanding of the history, the characters, and the story itself. </p>
                <p>Overall, we discovered that the main characters, such as Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr, were speaking
                    the most, referencing other characters the most, and being referenced the most as we expected due to their 
                    importance and prominence in the musical. Also, we discovered the phrases/words my shot, wait, and time 
                    were the most common phrases throughout the musical and each phrase can be connected to particular characters 
                    (such as Hamilton and my shot and Burr and wait) and conveyed major themes in the show (such as not waiting
                    for an opportunity, but making it yourself, how when you have an opportunity you should seize it and not
                    throw away your shot, and how precious time is when looking back at your life and how you spent it).
                    From this project, we gathered further insight to the history behind the lyrics through the personography 
                    displaying the actual historical figures mentioned in the musical's birth and death dates and occupations 
                    and the map which pinpoints the actual locations mentioned in the musical. There is a lot of other information 
                    to take from the lyrics and a lot more insights to make, and we encourage you to look around.</p>
