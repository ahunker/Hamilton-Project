                <p>Welcome to The Hamilton Project! <i><a href="http://www.hamiltonbroadway.com"
                            >Hamilton: An American Musical</a></i>, is a show that follows the life
                    of the United States first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton. It
                    became a worldwide sensation and has since won numerous awards. Our aim with
                    this project is to analyze Lin-Manuel Miranda's intricate lyrics in order to
                    gain a better understanding of the history, the characters, and the story
                    itself. </p>
                <p>Overall, we discovered that the main characters, such as Alexander Hamilton and
                    Aaron Burr, were speaking, referencing other characters, and being referenced
                    the most, as we expected, due to their importance and prominence in the musical.
                    Also, we discovered the phrases/words "my shot", "wait", and "time" were the
                    most common phrases throughout the musical. Each phrase can be connected to
                    particular characters (e.g. Hamilton with "my shot") and conveyed major themes
                    in the show (e.g. how precious "time" is when looking back at your life and how
                    you spent it or seizing the opportunity and not throwing away "your shot"). From
                    this project, we gathered further insight to the history behind the lyrics
                    through the personography, displaying facts about historical figures (birth and
                    death dates, occupation) and the map which pinpoints the locations mentioned in
                    the musical. There is a lot of other information to take from the lyrics and a
                    lot more insights to make, and we encourage you to look around.</p>
