                <p>The map displays all the places that are mentioned in <i>Hamilton: An American
                        Musical</i>. The majority of places are found in and around New York, which
                    makes a lot of sense since the majority of the musical is set in that area. The
                    other cluster of places is in England. Most likely these references occur during
                    the first act, which is set during the Revolutionary War. While the only
                    character that appears in England onstage is King George III, a lot of main
                    characters discuss England with a negative connotation as it is the source of
                    their subjugation.</p>
