            <h2>MORE ABOUT OUR PROJECT</h2>
            <p class="about">This project currently focuses on the lyrics in the musica <i>Hamilton: An American
                    Musical</i>. In regards to characters, we are looking specifically at who is
                talking the most in the musical versus who is talked about the most, who is
                connected to who, and the number of times one character mentions another character
                (E.g. the number of times Aaron Burr mentions Alexander Hamilton). Learning more
                about who a character talks about and is connected with can give us a better
                understanding of relationships between characters.</p>
            <p class="about">Another aspect were looking at in-depth is the repeated words found throughout
                multiple songs. There are several lines that are present in two or more songs. These
                phrases contribute towards characterization, the story, and themes present
                throughout the musical. We will look at where these phrases appear and track when
                they appear the most or don't appear at all in refards to the overall story.</p>
            <p class="about">Other elements we're interested in include dates and places. We're aiming to create a
                timeline on which to place songs and births or deaths that appear during the
                timeline of the musical. We will also aim to create a map to visualize the numerous
                places mentioned.</p>
