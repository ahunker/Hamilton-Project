            <h2>MORE ABOUT OUR PROJECT</h2>
            <p class="about">This project currently focuses on the lyrics in the musical
                    <i>Hamilton: An American Musical</i>. In regards to characters, we are looking
                specifically at who is talking the most in the musical versus who is talked about
                the most and who individual characters are referencing. Learning more about who a
                character talks about and is connected with can give us a better understanding of
                relationships between characters.</p>
            <p class="about">Another aspect we're looking at in-depth is the repeated words found
                throughout multiple songs. There are several lines that are present in three or more
                songs. These phrases contribute towards characterization, the story, and themes
                present throughout the musical. We will look at where these phrases appear and track
                when they appear the most or don't appear at all in regards to the overall
                story.</p>
            <p class="about">Other elements we're interested in include dates and places. We've
                created an interactive Google Map which features all the places mentioned in
                    <i>Hamilton</i> and in the description of each waypoint is a list of the songs
                that particular place is referenced. A future goal of this project is to create a
                timeline on which to place the songs, births, and deaths that appear during the
                timeline of the musical. </p>
