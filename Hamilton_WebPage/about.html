            <h2>MORE ABOUT OUR PROJECT</h2>
            <p class="about">This project currently focuses on the lyrics in the musical
                    <i>Hamilton: An American Musical</i>. In regards to characters, we are looking
                specifically at who is talking the most in the musical versus who is talked about
                the most and who individual characters are referencing. Learning more about who a
                character talks about and is connected with can give us a better understanding of
                relationships between characters.</p>
            <p class="about">Another aspect we're looking at in-depth is the repeated words found
                throughout multiple songs. There are several lines that are present in three or more
                songs. These phrases contribute towards characterization, the story, and themes
                present throughout the musical. We will look at where these phrases appear and track
                when they appear the most or don't appear at all in regards to the overall
                story.</p>
            <p class="about">Other elements we're interested in include dates and places. We've
                created an interactive Google Map which features all the places mentioned in
                    <i>Hamilton</i> and in the description of each waypoint is a list of the songs
                that particular place is referenced. A future goal of this project is to create a
                timeline on which to place the songs, births, and deaths that appear during the
                timeline of the musical. </p>

            <h2>METHODOLOGY</h2>
            <h3>Mark-up Process:</h3>
            <p class="about"> To start the project, we took the lyrics for the musical off of the
                Atlantic Records website and decided to mark them up using TEI. From there we
                created an ODD to identify which TEI elements we would be using in our project.
                Within the ODD we created Schemas that would fire on our attributes specific to
                phrases and names so no spelling errors would occur. and we used regular expressions
                to accurately tag all the elements we were planning to look further into during
                analysis. After tagging up all key elements and turning all the lyric text files
                into XML that kept the song's original format, the song's XML files were transformed
                using XSLT into HTML files featuring a JavaScript checklist box to highlight all the
                names, dates, phrases, and places in each song. </p>

            <h3>Frequency of Character References and Speeches Network Graphs:</h3>
            <p class="about"> One question we had while analysing the lyrics was about how often
                characters spoke in the musical and how often characters were referenced in the
                musical. We further wanted to investigate who references who as well to see which
                characters discuss each other and to see which characters talk about themselves. In
                order to investigate this, a directed network graph was created in Cytoscape to show
                the indegree of how often a character is referenced which is represented by the size
                of the nodes in the graph and the outdegree of how often a character speaks which is
                represented by the color of the nodes in the graph. To compile the information,
                XQuery was used to grab all distinct speakers and look down to see specific
                references to characters the speaker made throughout the entire musical. A TSV was
                saved from the output data and that was imported into cytoscape to compile the
                graph. In Cytoscape the edges which related to each song in the musical were bundled
                to help provide better readability. Another graph was created without bundling the
                edges to create separate network graphs for each song to show which characters
                referenced who in each song. A personography table, created using XSLT, lists the
                distinct names of people refenced by that character, who references that character,
                and the number of times that character is referenced.</p>

            <h3>Line Graph and Table of Repeated Phrases</h3>
            <p class="about">One of the goals of the project was to track repeated words/phrases
                within the musical. We chose eight distinct phrases: my shot, satisifed, helpless,
                wait, legacy, time, look around, and rise (up). For more information as to why we
                chose these phrases, please click <a href="vis_Phrases.html">here</a>. To
                investigate the frequency of these phrases, we created a line graph that would track
                each phrase in each song over the entire musical. Using XSLT to run over our
                collection of XML versions of the songs, we created an SVG graph. A corresponding
                table was created in the same fasion.</p>

            <h3>Map of Places Mentioned in <i>Hamilton: An American Musical</i></h3>
            <p class="about">To gain a better understanding of the more historical side of the
                musical, we chose to create a map that would visualize all the places mentioned in
                    <i>Hamilton</i>. XQuery was used to grab the distinct place names and we used a
                GPS Visualizer to obtain the geo co-ordinates in the form of a KML file. Using
                XQuery, a second KML file was produced that contained each place name and the list
                of songs that place appeared in. From there, an XSLT transformation combined the two
                KML files into one, which was uploaded onto Google Maps and embedded on our
                page.</p>
