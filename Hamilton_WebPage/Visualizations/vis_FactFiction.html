            <h2>Analysis:</h2>
            <p>The stacked bar graph of fact, fiction, and ambiguity in the lyrics of "Hamilton"
               offers great insight into the historical accuracy of the musical. When choosing
               lyrics, we focused on the ones that raised questions of authenticity. From there, we
               used "Alexander Hamilton," a biography by Ron Chernow, to determine whether a lyric
               was fact or fiction. In cases where Miranda merged fact and fiction together, didn't
               include the whole truth, or featured information that is debated by historians, we
               used the label of ambiguous.</p>
            <p>As seen above, he musical is mostly factual. This was surprising as it seemed, when
               we were marking up the text, that we were labelling most lyrics as fiction. When we
               actually pulled the data and saw the overwhelming amount of facts, we thought it was
               safe to say that the musical is fairly reliable as a historically accurate source.
               Although many of the lyrics were deemed as historically truthful, it is interesting
               to note that we were creating the timeline at the same time and we found that while
               the events Miranda included were factual, they were historically out of order.</p>
            <p>The lyrics that were fictional were either due to the limited amount characters, the
               character of Angelica, or humor. The median of the stage limited Miranda with the
               amount of characters that appeared onstage. Often he attributed actions to the main
               characters he selected that were actually performed by other historical figures who
               are only mentioned or do not appear at all in the musical. The most historically
               inaccurate character, though, was Angelica. Onstage, Angelica is a figure of
               feminism, an intelligent woman, and in love with Alexander. In reality, Angelica was
               married several years before she met him and happiily live with her husband, John
               Church, and they had eight children together. While she was definitely charming and
               intelligent, there is no evidence to suggest a proto-feminism mentality.</p>
            <p>Some of the most interesting lyrics were the 12 ambiguous oncs. Some lyrics
               highlighted things that are debated by historians, like the possiblity of Alexander
               and Angelica sharing romanitic feelings or Alexander and John Laurens' friendship
               extending into homosexuality. Another thing to note is the decision to not include
