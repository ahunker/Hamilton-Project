Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story

[WASHINGTON]
Let me tell you what I wish I’d known
When I was young and dreamed of glory
You have no control:

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?

[BURR]
President Jefferson:

[JEFFERSON]
I’ll give him this: his financial system is a
Work of genius. I couldn’t undo it if I tried
And I tried

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?

[BURR]
President Madison:

[MADISON]
He took our country from bankruptcy to prosperity
I hate to admit it, but he doesn’t get enough credit
For all the credit he gave us

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?

[ANGELICA]
Every other founding father's story gets told
Every other founding father gets to grow old

[BURR]
But when you’re gone, who remembers your name?
Who keeps your flame?

[BURR AND MEN]
Who tells your story?

Who tells your story?	 
[ANGELICA AND WOMEN]
Who tells your story?
Your story?

I live another fifty years
It’s not enough

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS]

[ELIZA AND COMPANY]
Time

[ELIZA]
I rely on—

[ELIZA AND ANGELICA]
Angelica

[ELIZA]
While she’s alive—

[ELIZA AND ANGELICA]
We tell your story

[ELIZA AND ANGELICA]
Near you

[ELIZA]
When I needed her most, she was right on—

[ELIZA AND COMPANY]
Time

[ELIZA]
And I’m still not through
I ask myself, “What would you do if you had more—”

[ELIZA AND COMPANY]
Time

[ELIZA]
The Lord, in his kindness
He gives me what you always wanted
He gives me more—

[ELIZA AND COMPANY]
Time

[ELIZA]
I raise funds in D.C. for the Washington Monument

[WASHINGTON]
She tells my story

[ELIZA]
I speak out against slavery
You could have done so much more if you only had—

[ELIZA AND COMPANY]
Time

[ELIZA]
And when my time is up, have I done enough?

[ELIZA]
Will they tell our story?	[COMPANY]
Will they tell your story?
 
[ELIZA]
Oh. Can I show you what I’m proudest of?

[COMPANY]
The orphanage

[ELIZA]
I established the first private orphanage in New York City

[COMPANY]
The orphanage

[ELIZA]
I help to raise hundreds of children
I get to see them growing up

[COMPANY]
The orphanage

[ELIZA]
In their eyes I see you, Alexander
I see you every—

[ELIZA AND COMPANY]
Time

[ELIZA]
And when my time is up
Have I done enough?
Will they tell my story?	 
 
[COMPANY]
Will they tell your story?
 
[ELIZA]
Oh, I can’t wait to see you again
It’s only a matter of—

[ELIZA AND COMPANY]
Time

[COMPANY]
Will they tell your story?

Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?

Will they tell your story?

Who lives, who dies—	 
[COMPANY]
Time…
