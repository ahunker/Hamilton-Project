Take A Break

[ELIZA]
Un deux trois quatre
Cinq six sept huit neuf

Good! Un deux trois quatre
Cinq six sept huit neuf

Sept huit neuf—

Sept huit neuf—	 
[PHILIP]
Un deux trois quatre
Cinq six sept huit neuf

Un deux trois quatre
Cinq six sept huit neuf

Sept huit neuf—

Sept huit neuf—
[ELIZA AND PHILIP]
One two three four five six seven eight nine!

[HAMILTON]
My dearest, Angelica
“Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day”
I trust you’ll understand the reference to
Another Scottish tragedy without my having to name the play
They think me Macbeth, and ambition is my folly
I’m a polymath, a pain in the ass, a massive pain
Madison is Banquo, Jefferson’s Macduff
And Birnam Wood is Congress on its way to Dunsinane

[HAMILTON/ANGELICA]
And there you are, an ocean away
Do you have to live an ocean away?
Thoughts of you subside
Then I get another letter
I cannot put the notion away…

[ELIZA]
Take a break

[HAMILTON]
I am on my way

[ELIZA]
There’s a little surprise before supper
And it cannot wait

[HAMILTON]
I’ll be there in just a minute, save my plate

[ELIZA]
Alexander—

[HAMILTON]
Okay, okay—

[ELIZA]
Your son is nine years old today
And he has something that he’d like to say
He’s been practicing all day
Philip, take it away—

[PHILIP]
Daddy, daddy, look—
My name is Philip
I am a poet
I wrote this poem just
To show it
And I just turned nine
You can write rhymes
But you can’t write mine

I practice French
And play piano with my mother

I have a sister, but I want a little brother

My daddy’s trying to start America’s bank
Un deux trois quatre cinq!	 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[HAMILTON]
What!


Uh-huh!


Okay!



Bravo!
 
[ELIZA]
Take a break

[HAMILTON]
Hey, our kid is pretty great

[ELIZA]
Run away with us for the summer
Let’s go upstate

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I’ve got so much on my plate

[ELIZA]
We can all go stay with my father
There’s a lake I know…

[HAMILTON]
I know

[ELIZA]
In a nearby park

[HAMILTON]
I’d love to go

[ELIZA]
You and I can go when the night gets dark…

[HAMILTON]
I will try to get away

[ANGELICA]
My dearest Alexander
You must get through to Jefferson
Sit down with him and compromise
Don’t stop ‘til you agree
Your fav’rite older sister
Angelica, reminds you
There’s someone in your corner all the way across the sea

In a letter I received from you two weeks ago
I noticed a comma in the middle of a phrase
It changed the meaning. Did you intend this?
One stroke and you’ve consumed my waking days
It says:

[HAMILTON/ANGELICA]
“My dearest Angelica”

[ANGELICA]
With a comma after “dearest.” You’ve written

[HAMILTON AND ANGELICA]
“My dearest, Angelica.”

[ANGELICA]
Anyway, all this to say
I’m coming home this summer
At my sister’s invitation
I’ll be there with your fam’ly
If you make your way upstate
I know you’re very busy
I know your work’s important
But I’m crossing the ocean and I just can’t wait

[HAMILTON AND ANGELICA]
You won’t be an ocean away
You will only be a moment away…

[ELIZA]
Alexander, come downstairs. Angelica’s arriving today!

[ELIZA]
Angelica!

[ANGELICA]
Eliza!

[HAMILTON]
The Schuyler sisters!

[ANGELICA]
Alexander

[HAMILTON]
Hi

[ANGELICA]
It’s good to see your face

[ELIZA]
Angelica, tell this man John Adams spends the summer with his family

[HAMILTON]
Angelica, tell my wife John Adams doesn’t have a real job anyway

[ANGELICA]
…you’re not joining us? Wait

[HAMILTON]
I’m afraid I cannot join you upstate

[ANGELICA]
Alexander, I came all this way

[ELIZA]
She came all this way—

[ANGELICA]
All this way—

[ELIZA AND ANGELICA]
Take a break

[HAMILTON]
You know I have to get my plan through Congress

[ELIZA AND ANGELICA]
Run away with us for the summer
Let’s go upstate

[HAMILTON]
I lose my job if we don’t get this plan through Congress

[ELIZA AND ANGELICA]
We can all go stay with our father

[ELIZA]
There’s a lake I know

In a nearby park


You and I can go

Take a break and get away—



Let’s go upstate
Where we can stay



Look around, look around
At how lucky we are to be alive right now—

We can go—
When the night gets dark
Take a break.	 
[ANGELICA]
I know I’ll miss your face—

Screw your courage to the sticking place—

Eliza’s right—
Take a break

Run away with us for the summer—
Let’s go upstate

We can all go stay with our father
If you take your time—

You will make your mark

Close your eyes and dream—

When the night gets dark
Take a break.
 
[HAMILTON]
I have to get my plan through Congress
I can’t stop until I get this plan through Congress
