Schuyler Defeated

[PHILIP]
Look!
Grandpa’s in the paper!
“War hero Philip Schuyler loses senate seat to young upstart Aaron Burr”
Grandpa just lost his seat in the senate

[ELIZA]
Sometimes that’s how it goes

[PHILIP]
Daddy’s gonna find out any minute

[ELIZA]
I’m sure he already knows

[PHILIP]
Further down

[PHILIP & ELIZA]
Further down

[PHILIP]
Let’s meet the newest senator from New York

[ELIZA]
New York

[PHILIP & ELIZA]
Our senator

[HAMILTON]
Burr?
Since when are you a Democratic-Republican?

[BURR]
Since being one put me on the up and up again

[HAMILTON]
No one knows who you are or what you do

[BURR]
They don’t need to know me
They don’t like you

[HAMILTON]
Excuse me?

[BURR]
Oh, Wall Street thinks you’re great
You’ll always be adored by the things you create
But upstate—

[HAMILTON]
Wait

[BURR]
—people think you’re crooked
Schuyler’s seat was up for grabs so I took it

[HAMILTON]
I’ve always considered you a friend

[BURR]
I don’t see why that has to end

[HAMILTON]
You changed parties to run against my father-in-law

[BURR]
I changed parties to seize the opportunity I saw
I swear your pride will be the death of us all
Beware, it goeth before the fall
