[HAMILTON]
Where’s my son?






Is he alive?	 
 
 
[DOCTOR]
Mr. Hamilton, come in. They brought him in a half an hour ago. He lost a lot of blood on the way over.
 
[DOCTOR]
Yes. But you have to understand
The bullet entered just above his hip and
Lodged in his right arm

[HAMILTON]
Can I see him please?

[DOCTOR]
I’m doing ev’rything I can, but the wound was
Already infected when he arrived—

[HAMILTON]
Philip

[PHILIP]

I did exactly as you said, Pa
I held my head up high

[HAMILTON]
I know, I know. Shh
I know, I know
Shh. I know you did
Ev’rything just right

Shh

I know, I know
I know, I know

Save your strength and
Stay alive…

Even before we got to ten—

I was aiming for the sky

I was aiming for the sky
