One Last Time

[HAMILTON]
Mr. President, you asked to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
I know you’re busy

[HAMILTON]
What do you need, sir? Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
I wanna give you a word of warning

[HAMILTON]
Sir, I don’t know what you heard
But whatever it is, Jefferson started it

[WASHINGTON]
Thomas Jefferson resigned this morning

[HAMILTON]
You’re kidding

[WASHINGTON]
I need a favor

[HAMILTON]
Whatever you say, sir, Jefferson will pay for his behavior

[WASHINGTON]
Shh. Talk less

[HAMILTON]
I’ll use the press
I’ll write under a pseudonym, you’ll see what I can do to him—

[WASHINGTON]
I need you to draft an address

[HAMILTON]
Yes! He resigned. You can finally speak your mind—

[WASHINGTON]
No, he’s stepping down so he can run for President

[HAMILTON]
Ha. Good luck defeating you, sir

[WASHINGTON]
I’m stepping down. I’m not running for President

[HAMILTON]
I’m sorry, what?

[WASHINGTON]
One last time
Relax, have a drink with me
One last time
Let’s take a break tonight
And then we’ll teach them how to say goodbye
To say goodbye
You and I

[HAMILTON]
No, sir, why?

[WASHINGTON]
I wanna talk about neutrality

[HAMILTON]
Sir, with Britain and France on the verge of war, is this the best time—

[WASHINGTON]
I want to warn against partisan fighting

[HAMILTON]
But—

[WASHINGTON]
Pick up a pen, start writing
I wanna talk about what I have learned
The hard-won wisdom I have earned

[HAMILTON]
As far as the people are concerned
You have to serve, you could continue to serve—

[WASHINGTON]
No! One last time
The people will hear from me
One last time
And if we get this right
We’re gonna teach ‘em how to say
Goodbye
You and I—

[HAMILTON]
Mr. President, they will say you’re weak

[WASHINGTON]
No, they will see we’re strong

[HAMILTON]
Your position is so unique

[WASHINGTON]
So I’ll use it to move them along

[HAMILTON]
Why do you have to say goodbye?

[WASHINGTON]
If I say goodbye, the nation learns to move on
It outlives me when I’m gone
Like the scripture says:
“Everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree
And no one shall make them afraid.”
They’ll be safe in the nation we’ve made
I wanna sit under my own vine and fig tree
A moment alone in the shade
At home in this nation we’ve made
One last time

[HAMILTON]
One last time

[HAMILTON]
Though, in reviewing the incidents of my administration, I am unconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. I shall also carry with me

[HAMILTON]
The hope
That my country will
View them with indulgence;
And that
After forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal
The faults of incompetent abilities will be
Consigned to oblivion, as I myself must soon be to the mansions of rest
I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat in which I promise myself to realize the sweet enjoyment of partaking, in the midst of my fellow-citizens, the benign influence of good laws
Under a free government, the ever-favorite object of my heart, and the happy reward, as I trust
Of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers.	[WASHINGTON]

One last time

[ALL WOMEN]
George Washington’s going home!

[HAMILTON]
Teach ‘em how to say goodbye

 
 
[WASHINGTON]
You and I


Going home


History has its eyes on you


We’re gonna teach ‘em how to
Say goodbye!
Teach ‘em how to
Say goodbye!
To say goodbye!

Say goodbye!
