Your Obedient Servant

[BURR]
How does Hamilton
An arrogant
Immigrant, orphan
Bastard, whoreson
Somehow endorse
Thomas Jefferson, his enemy
A man he’s despised since the beginning
Just to keep me from winning?
I wanna be in the room where it happens—

[BURR AND COMPANY]
The room where it happens
The room where it happens

[BURR]
You’ve kept me from—

[BURR AND COMPANY]
The room where it happens

[BURR]
For the last time

Dear Alexander:

I am slow to anger
But I toe the line
As I reckon with the effects
Of your life on mine
I look back on where I failed
And in every place I checked
The only common thread has been your disrespect
Now you call me “amoral,”
A “dangerous disgrace,”
If you’ve got something to say
Name a time and place
Face to face

I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant
A dot Burr

Mr. Vice President:

I am not the reason no one trusts you
No one knows what you believe
I will not equivocate on my opinion
I have always worn it on my sleeve
Even if I said what you think I said
You would need to cite a more specific grievance
Here’s an itemized list of thirty years of disagreements

[BURR]
Sweet Jesus

[HAMILTON]
Hey, I have not been shy
I am just a guy in the public eye
Tryin’ to do my best for our republic
I don’t wanna fight
But I won’t apologize for doing what’s right

I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant
A dot Ham

[BURR]
Careful how you proceed, good man
Intemperate indeed, good man
Answer for the accusations I lay at your feet or
Prepare to bleed, good man

[HAMILTON]
Burr, your grievance is legitimate
I stand by what I said, every bit of it
You stand only for yourself
It’s what you do
I can’t apologize because it’s true

[BURR]
Then stand, Alexander
Weehawken. Dawn
Guns. Drawn

[HAMILTON]
You’re on

[BURR AND HAMILTON]
I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant
