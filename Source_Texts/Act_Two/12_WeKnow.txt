We Know

[HAMILTON]
Mr. Vice President
Mr. Madison
Senator Burr
What is this?

[JEFFERSON]
We have the check stubs. From separate accounts…

[MADISON]
Almost a thousand dollars, paid in different amounts…

[BURR]
To a Mr. James Reynolds way back in
Seventeen ninety-one

[HAMILTON]
Is that what you have? Are you done?

[MADISON]
You are uniquely situated by virtue of your position—

[JEFFERSON]
Though ‘virtue’ is not a word I’d apply to this situation—

[MADISON]
To seek financial gain, to stray from your sacred mission—

[JEFFERSON]
And the evidence suggests you’ve engaged in speculation—

[BURR]
An immigrant embezzling our government funds—

[JEFFERSON/MADISON]
I can almost see the headline, your career is done

[BURR]
I hope you saved some money for your daughter and sons

[BURR/JEFFERSON/MADISON]
Ya best g'wan run back where ya come from!

[HAMILTON]
Ha! You don’t even know what you’re asking me to confess

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR]
Confess

[HAMILTON]
You have nothing. I don’t have to tell you anything at all
Unless

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR]
Unless

[HAMILTON]
If I can prove that I never broke the law
Do you promise not to tell another soul what you saw?

[BURR]
No one else was in the room where it happened

[HAMILTON]
Is that a yes?

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR]
Um, yes

[BURR]
“Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health
And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
In the pockets of people like me: down on their luck
You see, it was my wife who you decided to—”

[JEFFERSON]
Whaaaat—

[HAMILTON]
She courted me
Escorted me to bed and when she had me in a corner
That’s when Reynolds extorted me
For a sordid fee
I paid him quarterly
I may have mortally wounded my prospects
But my papers are orderly!
As you can see I kept a record of every check in my checkered
History. Check it again against your list n’ see consistency
I never spent a cent that wasn’t mine
You sent the dogs after my scent, that’s fine
Yes, I have reasons for shame
But I have not committed treason and sullied my good name
As you can see I have done nothing to provoke legal action
Are my answers to your satisfaction?

[JEFFERSON]
My God

[MADISON]
Gentlemen, let’s go

[HAMILTON]
So?

[JEFFERSON AND MADISON]
The people won't know what we know

[HAMILTON]
Burr!
How do I know you won’t use this against me
The next time we go toe to toe?

[BURR]
Alexander, rumors only grow. And we both
Know what we know
