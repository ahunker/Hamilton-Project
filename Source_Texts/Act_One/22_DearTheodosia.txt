Dear Theodosia

[BURR]
Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?
You have my eyes. You have your mother’s name

When you came into the world, you cried and it broke my heart

I’m dedicating every day to you
Domestic life was never quite my style
When you smile, you knock me out, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart

You will come of age with our young nation
We’ll bleed and fight for you, we’ll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We’ll pass it on to you, we’ll give the world to you
And you’ll blow us all away…
Someday, someday
Yeah, you’ll blow us all away
Someday, someday

[HAMILTON]
Oh Philip, when you smile I am undone
My son
Look at my son. Pride is not the word I’m looking for

There is so much more inside me now
Oh Philip, you outshine the morning sun
My son
When you smile, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart
My father wasn’t around

[BURR]
My father wasn’t around

[HAMILTON]
I swear that
I’ll be around for you.	 
[BURR]
I’ll be around for you.
 
[HAMILTON]
I’ll do whatever it takes

[BURR]
I’ll make a million mistakes

[BURR/HAMILTON]
I’ll make the world safe and sound for you…
…will come of age with our young nation
We’ll bleed and fight for you, we’ll make it right for you

If we lay a strong enough foundation
We’ll pass it on to you, we’ll give the world to you
And you’ll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you’ll blow us all away
Someday, someday
