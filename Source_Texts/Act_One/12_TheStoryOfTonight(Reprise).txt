The Story of Tonight (Reprise)

[LAURENS]
I may not live to see our glory!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I may not live to see our glory!

[LAURENS]
But I’ve seen wonders great and small

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
I’ve seen wonders great and small

[LAURENS]
‘Cause if the tomcat can get married

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
If Alexander can get married—

[LAURENS]
There’s hope for our ass, after all!

[LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass to freedom

[LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

[MULLIGAN]
No matter what she tells you

[LAFAYETTE]
Let’s have another round tonight!

[LAURENS]
Raise a glass to the four of us!

[LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Ho!

[MULLIGAN]
To the newly not poor of us!

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON]
Woo!

[LAFAYETTE]
We’ll tell the story of tonight

[LAURENS]
Let’s have another round—

[HAMILTON]
Well, if it isn’t Aaron Burr

[BURR]
Sir!

[HAMILTON]
I didn’t think that you would make it

[BURR]
To be sure

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE]
Burr!

[BURR]
I came to say congratulations

[MULLIGAN]
Spit a verse, Burr!

[BURR]
I see the whole gang is here

[LAFAYETTE]
You are the worst, Burr!

[HAMILTON]
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George’s journal

[BURR]
No, you don’t

[HAMILTON]
Yes, I do

[BURR]
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you’ve made yourself indispensable

[LAURENS]
Well, well, I heard
You’ve got a special someone on the side, Burr

[HAMILTON]
Is that so?

[LAURENS]
What are you tryin’ to hide, Burr?

[BURR]
I should go

[HAMILTON]
No, these guys should go

[LAFAYETTE]
What?

[LAURENS]
No!

[HAMILTON]
Leave us alone

[MULLIGAN]
Man…

[HAMILTON]
It’s alright, Burr. I wish you’d brought this girl with you tonight, Burr

[BURR]
You’re very kind, but I’m afraid it’s unlawful, sir

[HAMILTON]
What do you mean?

[BURR]
She’s married

[HAMILTON]
I see

[BURR]
She’s married to a British officer

[HAMILTON]
Oh shit…

[BURR]
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
I’ll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?

[BURR]
I’ll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I’ll see you on the other side of the war
