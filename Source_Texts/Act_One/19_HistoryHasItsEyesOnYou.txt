History has its Eyes on You

[WASHINGTON]
I was younger than you are now
When I was given my first command
I led my men straight into a massacre
I witnessed their deaths firsthand
I made every mistake
And felt the shame rise in me
And even now I lie awake

[WASHINGTON]
Knowing history has its eyes on me



[HAMILTON/WASHINGTON]
History has its eyes on me.	[LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Whoa…
Whoa…
Whoa…
Yeah

[COMPANY]
Whoa…
Whoa…
Whoa…
Yeah
 
[WASHINGTON]
Let me tell you what I wish I’d known
When I was young and dreamed of glory:
You have no control:

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story

[WASHINGTON]
I know that we can win
I know that greatness lies in you
But remember from here on in

[WASHINGTON/HAMILTON AND MEN]
History has its
Eyes on you.	 
 
[ENSEMBLE]
Whoa…
Whoa…
Whoa…
[FULL COMPANY]
History has its eyes on you
