Tomorrow There'll Be More of Us

[LAURENS]
I may not live to see our glory

[ELIZA]
Alexander? There's a letter for you

[HAMILTON]
It's from John Laurens. I'll read it later

[LAURENS]
But I will gladly join the fight

[ELIZA]
No. It's from his father

[HAMILTON]
His father?

[LAURENS]
And when our children tell our story

[HAMILTON]
Will you read it?

[LAURENS]
They'll tell the story of tonight
 

[ELIZA]
"On Tuesday the 27th, my son was killed in a gunfight against British troops retreating from South Carolina. The war was already over. As you know, John dreamed of emancipating and recruiting 3000 men for the first all-black military regiment
His dream of freedom for these men dies with him."

[LAURENS]
Tomorrow there'll be more of us...

[ELIZA]
Alexander. Are you alright?

[HAMILTON]
I have so much work to do
