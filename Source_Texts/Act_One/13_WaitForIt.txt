Wait for It

[BURR]
Theodosia writes me a letter every day
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it

[BURR]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher
 
 
But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya
 
 
My mother was a genius
 
My father commanded respect
 
When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

Death doesn’t discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there’s a reason I’m still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I’m willing to wait for it
I’m willing to wait for it

Wait for it

Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb

[ENSEMBLE]
Climb
Climb

[BURR]
He has something to prove
He has nothing to lose

[ENSEMBLE]

Hamilton’s pace is relentless
He wastes no time

[ENSEMBLE]
Time
Time
Time

[BURR]
What is it like in his shoes?

Hamilton doesn’t hesitate
He exhibits no restraint
He takes and he takes and he takes
And he keeps winning anyway
He changes the game
He plays and he raises the stakes
And if there’s a reason
He seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit—

[BURR]
I'm willing to wait for it
 
 
I'm willing to wait for it...

Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes

We rise
We fall

And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to—
 	[COMPANY]
I'm willing to wait for it

Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall and we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to—
